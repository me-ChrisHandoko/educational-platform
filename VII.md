  gateways: {
    primary: {
      provider: "Midtrans";
      methods: ["bank_transfer", "credit_card", "gopay", "ovo"];
      features: ["tokenization", "recurring", "3ds"];
    };
    secondary: {
      provider: "Xendit";
      methods: ["virtual_account", "ewallet", "retail_outlet"];
      features: ["disbursement", "invoice", "webhook"];
    };
    fallback: {
      provider: "Doku";
      methods: ["credit_card", "bank_transfer"];
      features: ["fraud_detection", "installment"];
    };
  };

  };

  // Performance metrics
  performance: {
    uptime: "99.99% SLA";
    processingTime: "<3 seconds";
    settlementTime: "T+1 for most methods";
  };
}
```

**Payment Security & Compliance:**

```typescript
const paymentSecurity = {
  // Data protection
  encryption: {
    card: "Tokenization via payment gateway",
    transmission: "TLS 1.3 minimum",
    storage: "No card data stored locally",
  },

  // Fraud prevention
  fraud: {
    detection: "ML-based transaction monitoring",
    rules: "Velocity checks, amount limits",
    verification: "3D Secure for cards",
  },

  // Compliance
  compliance: {
    pci: "PCI DSS via tokenization",
    localRegulations: "OJK compliant",
    dataPrivacy: "GDPR + local privacy laws",
  },
};
```

### ✅ Billing Technology Stack

**Job Queue Architecture:**

```typescript
// Billing automation with job queues
const billingJobQueue = {
  // Queue configuration
  queues: {
    invoiceGeneration: {
      processor: "Bull",
      concurrency: 10,
      schedule: "Cron-based monthly",
    },
    paymentReminders: {
      processor: "Bull",
      concurrency: 50,
      schedule: "Dynamic based on due dates",
    },
    reconciliation: {
      processor: "Bull",
      concurrency: 5,
      schedule: "Every 6 hours",
    },
  },

  // Job types
  jobs: {
    generateInvoice: {
      retries: 3,
      timeout: "5 minutes",
      priority: "high",
    },
    sendReminder: {
      retries: 5,
      timeout: "30 seconds",
      priority: "normal",
    },
    processWebhook: {
      retries: 10,
      timeout: "10 seconds",
      priority: "critical",
    },

### ✅ Billing Performance Optimization

**Database Optimization:**

```sql
-- Optimized billing queries with indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_tenant_date ON invoices(tenant_id, invoice_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_status_date ON payments(status, payment_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_students_active_tenant ON students(tenant_id, status) WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';

-- Materialized view for billing analytics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW billing_analytics AS
SELECT
  tenant_id,
  DATE_TRUNC('month', invoice_date) as month,
  COUNT(*) as invoice_count,
  SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'PAID' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) as collected_revenue,
  AVG(EXTRACT(DAY FROM payment_date - due_date)) as avg_payment_delay
FROM invoices
LEFT JOIN payments ON invoices.id = payments.invoice_id
GROUP BY tenant_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', invoice_date);
```

**Caching Strategy:**

```typescript
const billingCacheStrategy = {
  // Cache layers
  layers: {
    redis: {
      tenantPricing: "24 hours",
      invoiceData: "1 hour",
      paymentMethods: "Session duration",
      analytics: "6 hours",
    },
    database: {
      queryCache: "Prepared statements",
      connectionPool: "PgBouncer",
    },
    api: {
      httpCache: "CloudFlare for static assets",
      edgeCache: "Regional edge servers",
    },
  },

  // Cache invalidation
  invalidation: {
    event: "Price changes, new payments",
    time: "TTL-based expiration",
    manual: "Admin cache flush option",
  },
};
```

### ✅ Billing Integration APIs

**RESTful Billing API:**

```typescript
// Billing API endpoints
const billingAPI = {
  // Tenant management
  "/api/billing/tenants": {
    GET: "List all tenant billing configs",
    POST: "Create new tenant pricing",
  },
  "/api/billing/tenants/:id": {
    GET: "Get tenant billing details",
    PUT: "Update tenant pricing",
    DELETE: "Deactivate tenant billing",
  },

    POST: "Generate custom report",
  },
};
```

**GraphQL Billing Schema:**

```graphql
type Tenant {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  billing: TenantBilling!
  invoices: [Invoice!]!
  payments: [Payment!]!
}

type TenantBilling {
  pricingModel: PricingModel!
  billingCycle: BillingCycle!
  currentBalance: Float!
  nextBillingDate: DateTime!
  paymentStatus: PaymentStatus!
}

type Invoice {
  id: ID!
  invoiceNumber: String!
  tenant: Tenant!
  amount: Float!
  dueDate: DateTime!
  status: InvoiceStatus!
  lineItems: [LineItem!]!
  payments: [Payment!]!
}

type Query {
  tenant(id: ID!): Tenant
  invoice(id: ID!): Invoice
  billingAnalytics(tenantId: ID, startDate: DateTime!, endDate: DateTime!): BillingAnalytics!
}

type Mutation {
  updateTenantPricing(tenantId: ID!, input: TenantPricingInput!): Tenant!
