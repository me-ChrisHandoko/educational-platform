// Gunakan repository pattern
export class StudentRepository {
  // Copilot akan auto-complete CRUD operations
}

// DTO validation dengan class-validator
export class CreateStudentDto {
  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  name: string;
  // Copilot understands the pattern
}
```

#### 2. **Component Libraries**

- Jangan build from scratch
- Use Shadcn/ui untuk UI components
