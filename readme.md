```

### Critical Success Factors:

#### 1. **Architecture First**

```typescript
// Start dengan clean architecture
src/
├── modules/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── students/
│   ├── academic/
│   ├── parents/     // New parent module
│   └── common/
├── shared/
│   ├── database/
│   ├── guards/
│   ├── notifications/  // Notification service
│   └── utils/
└── config/
```

#### 2. **Database Design Excellence**

```sql
-- Simplified but scalable schema
-- Focus pada relasi yang clean
-- Avoid over-engineering early
-- Parent portal as first-class citizen
```

#### 3. **AI Tools Optimization**

**GitHub Copilot Best Practices:**

- Write clear function names & comments first
- Let Copilot generate boilerplate
- Always review & refactor suggestions
- Use for test generation

**Claude Pro Usage:**

- Architecture decisions consultation
- Complex query optimization
- Security best practices
- Code review assistance

### Time-Saving Strategies:

#### 1. **Use Proven Patterns**

```typescript
// Gunakan repository pattern
export class StudentRepository {
  // Copilot akan auto-complete CRUD operations
}

// DTO validation dengan class-validator
export class CreateStudentDto {
  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  name: string;
  // Copilot understands the pattern
}
```

#### 2. **Component Libraries**

- Jangan build from scratch
- Use Shadcn/ui untuk UI components
- Customize sesuai kebutuhan

#### 3. **Smart Testing**

```typescript
// Focus pada integration tests
// Skip unit tests untuk CRUD sederhana
// AI generates test cases
describe("Student Enrollment", () => {
  // Critical path testing only
});
```
