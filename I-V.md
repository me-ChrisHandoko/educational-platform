### Comprehensive Billing Architecture

The billing system is designed to accommodate diverse business models with complete flexibility in pricing, billing periods, discounts, and automation.

### Dynamic Tenant Pricing Configuration

```typescript
interface TenantBillingConfig {
  // Tenant identification
  tenantId: string;
  tenantName: string;

  // Flexible pricing models
  pricingModel: {
    type: "PER_STUDENT" | "HYBRID" | "TIERED" | "ENTERPRISE";
    currency: "IDR" | "USD";

    // Per-student pricing
    baseStudentPrice: number; // e.g., Rp 10,000 - 20,000

    // Optional fixed components
    monthlyBaseFee?: number; // Fixed platform fee
    includedStudents?: number; // Students included in base fee

    // Volume-based discounts
    volumeTiers?: Array<{
      minStudents: number;
      maxStudents: number;
      pricePerStudent: number;
      discountPercentage?: number;
    }>;
  };

  // Flexible billing periods
  billingCycle: {
    period: "MONTHLY" | "QUARTERLY" | "SEMI_ANNUAL" | "ANNUAL" | "CUSTOM";
    customMonths?: number; // For non-standard periods

    // Payment incentives
    discounts: {
      annualPayment: number; // e.g., 10% for annual
      earlyPayment: number; // e.g., 2% within 7 days
      multiYear: number; // e.g., 15% for 2+ years
    };

    // Billing schedule
    startDate: Date;
    nextBillingDate: Date;
    paymentTerms: number; // Days to pay
  };

  // Contract management
  contract: {
    type: "STANDARD" | "CUSTOM" | "ENTERPRISE";
    startDate: Date;
    endDate?: Date;
    autoRenewal: boolean;
    gracePeriodDays: number;
    specialTerms?: string;
  };
}
```

### Billing Examples by Tenant Type

#### Example 1: Small School Network (100-500 students)

  tenantName: "Yayasan Pendidikan Harapan",
  pricingModel: {
    type: "PER_STUDENT",
    currency: "IDR",
    baseStudentPrice: 10000, // Rp 10,000 per student/month
  },
  billingCycle: {
    period: "MONTHLY",
    discounts: {
      annualPayment: 10, // 10% discount if paid annually
      earlyPayment: 2, // 2% if paid within 7 days
      multiYear: 0,
    },
    paymentTerms: 30, // 30 days to pay
  },
};
```

      { minStudents: 1001, maxStudents: 2000, pricePerStudent: 10000 },
    ],
  },
  billingCycle: {
    period: "ANNUAL",
    discounts: {
      annualPayment: 10, // Already annual

        await this.sendInvoice(invoice);
        await this.scheduleReminders(invoice);
      }
    }
  }

  // Smart invoice calculation
  async createInvoice(tenant: Tenant): Promise<Invoice> {
    const config = tenant.billingConfig;
    const studentCount = await this.getActiveStudentCount(tenant.id);
    const billingPeriod = this.getBillingPeriodMultiplier(config);

    // Calculate base charges
    let subtotal = 0;
    let lineItems = [];

    // Apply volume-based pricing
    const effectiveRate = this.calculateEffectiveRate(studentCount, config);
    const studentCharges = studentCount * effectiveRate * billingPeriod;

    lineItems.push({
      description: `Student Licenses (${studentCount} × Rp ${effectiveRate.toLocaleString(
        "id-ID"
      )})`,
      quantity: studentCount,
      rate: effectiveRate,
      amount: studentCharges,
    });

    subtotal += studentCharges;

    // Add base fee if applicable
    if (config.pricingModel.monthlyBaseFee) {
      const baseFee = config.pricingModel.monthlyBaseFee * billingPeriod;
      lineItems.push({
        description: "Platform Base Fee",
        amount: baseFee,
      });
      subtotal += baseFee;
    }

    // Apply discounts
    const discounts = this.calculateDiscounts(subtotal, config);
    const taxableAmount = subtotal - discounts.total;
    const tax = taxableAmount * 0.11; // PPN 11%

    return {
      invoiceNumber: this.generateInvoiceNumber(),
      tenantId: tenant.id,
      invoiceDate: new Date(),
      dueDate: this.calculateDueDate(config),
      lineItems,

      discounts: discounts.items,
      tax,
      total: taxableAmount + tax,
      status: "PENDING",
    };
  }

  // Automated payment reminders
  async scheduleReminders(invoice: Invoice) {
    const reminderSchedule = [
      { days: -7, type: "FRIENDLY" }, // 7 days before
      { days: 0, type: "DUE_DATE" }, // On due date
      { days: 3, type: "OVERDUE" }, // 3 days after
      { days: 7, type: "URGENT" }, // 7 days after
      { days: 14, type: "FINAL" }, // 14 days after
